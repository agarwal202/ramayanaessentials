<div><p style="text-align:bottom;font-family:times-new roman;font-size:large;color:white;">The Ramayana written by Tulsidas known 
as <span style="color:orange">Ramcharitmanas</span>,is a sixteenth century epic. The story evolves around <span style="color:orange">Rama</span>,who 
was the seventh avatar of the Hindu God <span style="color:orange">Vishnu</span>. He is the central figure of the Hindu epic <span style="color:orange">
Ramayana</span>,which is the principal narration of events connected to his incarnations on earth,his ideals and his greatness. 
<span style="color:orange"> His soul motive was to destroy evil forces on Earth and relieve kind people</span>. 
He was the eldest son of King Dashratha-ruler of the Kosala Kingdom or Adhyodha, Present-day Uttar Pradesh. Rama's life and journey is one of 
adherence to dharma despite harsh treats and obstacles and many pairs of life and time. This adherence made him earn the name of 
<span style="color:orange">Maryada Purushottam Ram</span> which literally means <span style="color:orange">The Perfect Man</span> or 
<span style="color:orange">Lord of Self-Control</span> or <span style="color:orange">Lord of Virtue</span>. For the sake of his father's honour, 
Rama abandons his claim to Adhyodha's throne to serve an exile of fourtenn years in the forest. His wife Sita and brother Lakshmana decide to join 
him and all three spend the fourteen years in exile together. While in exile, <span style="color:orange">Sita was kidnapped by Ravana,the demon king 
of Lanka, Present-day Sri Lanka</span>. After a long and ardous search, Rama fights a colossal war against Ravana's armies. In a war of powerful and 
magical beings,greatly destructive weaponery and battles, Rama slays Ravana in battle and liberates his wife. Having completed his exile, Rama 
returns to be crowned king in Adhyodha and eventually becomes the emperor. The whole is is divided into seven parts known as Kandas. Below is the 
link for the seven kandas of Ramayana.</p></div>
